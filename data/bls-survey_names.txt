		           Multiple responses are separated by '|'. The 'Cleaned' columns denote associated states
			   and countries where applicable, following the logic that smaller towns, if mentioned
		           alongside more general waterbodies, would be used to indicate a specific area where a
	                   boat would have been launched. Mentions of oceans and states are reduced to state names
		           when applicable.
